            <h2>Project Details</h2>
        </div>
		<p>Stellantis Manufacturing - Work Management System/ Assembly Stamping Plant Systems  / Stamping Powertrain Plant Systems</p>
        <p>The Work Management System (WMS) is a web application used for Chrysler’s infrastructure maintenance.It allows employees to create a Service Request (SR) to address their infrastructure needs at any Chrysler facility. WMS supported Service Request such as Telephone/Computer/Data Line Request,Key Request and General Request<p>
<p>Executive reporting system provides the daily state of plant report (also known as PC1 report) to the executive committee of FCA. 
This is a high visibility system as without these reports the executive committee cannot get to know the earlier day(s) status.  
In addition to the above reports, there are other information generated by the system namely production plant calendar for assembly plants,  weekly work schedule, scheduled vs. assembled report and data for press release.  
ERS generates the reports with the inputs from vehicle production counting system, plant production reporting, assembly plant info, production calendar, material protection, engineering data and MDP – market demand planning.</p>
<p>The PFS website(PFS) is a tool for the assembly plants to aid in their day-to-day operations. 
All the reports are grouped under 6 categories (Executive – for higher ups, Supervisor – plant supervisor level, Team – Team level, Engineer- Analyst level, Surface Finish – issues deal with surface finish, Support-Glossary and information</p>
<p>Vehicle Order Processing (VOP) handles Vehicle Orders from Highland Park to the assembly plants. Orders are processed and reformatted for use by others systems. Mainframe applications include plants Order entry, Vehicle Edit, Miscellaneous Records processing, Ad Hoc Reporting at assembly plants, and end of Production Processing that synchronizes the HPDC Data base to the plant visa file. Key words that may indicate the problem belongs to this group are Visa file or Vehicle Order Processing</p>
<p>Broadcast - Tracks Vehicle Status and Vehicle Build Documents.Cics Applications on Regional Data centers with 3270 Environment Terminals and Printers.
There is some communications MVS TCP/IP to AVI and VMS Wcc controllers and this group supports all assembly plants
</p>
<p>The ACC (Assembly Common Configuration) will provide a J2EE web interface for assembly plant users to configure Conveyor, Segments, IOCards and station attributes required by various assembly sub-systems. The data entered via ACC user interface will be stored in a central database. Subsequently, appropriate sub-systems will be notified to initiate synchronization of the station configuration. The system will be designed to minimize user data entry and error proof user interaction</p>
<p>Manufacturing Dashboard is a web portal that displays both static and dynamic content of the various units that are coming under the manufacturing unit namely Stamping, Power train and Assembly.
This application pulls data from various applications (Databases) such as PDR (production), CATS (Labor), Scheduling (CMIS), Inventory (OPTS) and Shipping (SDS) to create the dynamic report.
It is distributed across the various plants such as WSP, SSP and TSP data centers.
</p>
<p>Mopar Macs is mopar automated catalog systems it’s a  Catalog for the Client and also its has graphical diagram for the each automated parts and systems.EPC is electronic parts catalog systems which is also a cataloging systems involves the accessories things of vehicle will be loaded to star parts enduser from EPC.</p>
