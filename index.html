		<p>Exceed application - Receiving is the process of bringing products purchased from a vendor into a warehouse. Products are usually stored for some length of time and then shipped to the store. When a delivery truck arrives at the warehouse, the warehouse personnel must be equipped and prepared to transfer the product from the truck to the appropriate storage location.This requires scheduling of receipts though the appointments maintenance system. The host systems transfers information to the EXE to facilitate the receipt of the product.The EXE represents the truck as an appointment.
The appointment is basically a list of POs to be received and the expected time of truck arrival to the WHSE.
This allows the personnel to plan receiving to avoid congestion etc. and move the products to appropriate storage locations.
As the WHSE knows in advance what is in the truck, he/she can create all receiving documents including pallet labels of what is being received on a particular PO, before the truck arrives.
Putaway is a process of  taking the pallets from the receving doors to the appropriate storage location within the warehouse, thus, making the pallet part of the Inventory.
Verification is the process of double-checking the receivers and making sure that they didn’t miscount the received quantity, and to close the PO and complete the appointment

       <p>Executive reporting system provides the daily state of plant report (also known as PC1 report) to the executive committee of FCA. 
This is a high visibility system as without these reports the executive committee cannot get to know the earlier day(s) status.  
In addition to the above reports, there are other information generated by the system namely production plant calendar for assembly plants,  weekly work schedule, scheduled vs. assembled report and data for press release.  
ERS generates the reports with the inputs from vehicle production counting system, plant production reporting, assembly plant info, production calendar, material protection, engineering data and MDP – market demand planning.</p>
<p>The PFS website(PFS) is a tool for the assembly plants to aid in their day-to-day operations. 
All the reports are grouped under 6 categories (Executive – for higher ups, Supervisor – plant supervisor level, Team – Team level, Engineer- Analyst level, Surface Finish – issues deal with surface finish, Support-Glossary and information</p>
<p>Vehicle Order Processing (VOP) handles Vehicle Orders from Highland Park to the assembly plants. Orders are processed and reformatted for use by others systems. Mainframe applications include plants Order entry, Vehicle Edit, Miscellaneous Records processing, Ad Hoc Reporting at assembly plants, and end of Production Processing that synchronizes the HPDC Data base to the plant visa file. Key words that may indicate the problem belongs to this group are Visa file or Vehicle Order Processing</p>
<p>Broadcast - Tracks Vehicle Status and Vehicle Build Documents.Cics Applications on Regional Data centers with 3270 Environment Terminals and Printers.
There is some communications MVS TCP/IP to AVI and VMS Wcc controllers and this group supports all assembly plants
</p>
<p>The ACC (Assembly Common Configuration) will provide a J2EE web interface for assembly plant users to configure Conveyor, Segments, IOCards and station attributes required by various assembly sub-systems. The data entered via ACC user interface will be stored in a central database. Subsequently, appropriate sub-systems will be notified to initiate synchronization of the station configuration. The system will be designed to minimize user data entry and error proof user interaction</p>
<p>Manufacturing Dashboard is a web portal that displays both static and dynamic content of the various units that are coming under the manufacturing unit namely Stamping, Power train and Assembly.
This application pulls data from various applications (Databases) such as PDR (production), CATS (Labor), Scheduling (CMIS), Inventory (OPTS) and Shipping (SDS) to create the dynamic report.
It is distributed across the various plants such as WSP, SSP and TSP data centers.
</p>
 <p>The Work Management System (WMS) is a web application used for Chrysler’s infrastructure maintenance.It allows employees to create a Service Request (SR) to address their infrastructure needs at any Chrysler facility. WMS supported Service Request such as Telephone/Computer/Data Line Request,Key Request and General Request<p>
<p>Mopar Macs is mopar automated catalog systems it’s a  Catalog for the Client and also its has graphical diagram for the each automated parts and systems.EPC is electronic parts catalog systems which is also a cataloging systems involves the accessories things of vehicle will be loaded to star parts enduser from EPC.</p>
