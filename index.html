		<p>Stellantis Manufacturing - Work Management System/ Assembly Stamping Plant Systems  / Stamping Powertrain Plant Systems</p>
        <p>The Work Management System (WMS) is a web application used for Chrysler’s infrastructure maintenance.It allows employees to create a Service Request (SR) to address their infrastructure needs at any Chrysler facility. WMS supported Service Request such as Telephone/Computer/Data Line Request,Key Request and General Request<p>
<p>The PFS website is a tool for the assembly plants to aid in their day-to-day operations. 
All the reports are grouped under 6 categories (Executive – for higher ups, Supervisor – plant supervisor level, Team – Team level, Engineer- Analyst level, Surface Finish – issues deal with surface finish, Support-Glossary and information</p>
<p>Vehicle Order Processing (VOP) handles Vehicle Orders from Highland Park to the assembly plants. Orders are processed and reformatted for use by others systems. Mainframe applications include plants Order entry, Vehicle Edit, Miscellaneous Records processing, Ad Hoc Reporting at assembly plants, and end of Production Processing that synchronizes the HPDC Data base to the plant visa file. Key words that may indicate the problem belongs to this group are Visa file or Vehicle Order Processing</p>
<p>Broadcast - Tracks Vehicle Status and Vehicle Build Documents.Cics Applications on Regional Data centers with 3270 Environment Terminals and Printers.
There is some communications MVS TCP/IP to AVI and VMS Wcc controllers and this group supports all assembly plants
</p>
<p>Manufacturing Dashboard is a web portal that displays both static and dynamic content of the various units that are coming under the manufacturing unit namely Stamping, Power train and Assembly.
This application pulls data from various applications (Databases) such as PDR (production), CATS (Labor), Scheduling (CMIS), Inventory (OPTS) and Shipping (SDS) to create the dynamic report.
It is distributed across the various plants such as WSP, SSP and TSP data centers.
